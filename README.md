# Traffic-Light-Controller-using-Finite-State-Machine
This FSM manages a 4-way intersection. It cycles through NS Green (30 cycles), NS Yellow (5), EW Green (30), and EW Yellow (5) . Using a 6-bit counter and synchronous reset to NS Green, it ensures safety by preventing simultaneous green lights . Verified via Verilog, the design is scalable for sensors.
